# Agile Content

## Homepage

- A search input that allows you to search for animals, the retrieved results will be
  displayed on the results page
- Header and footer are just visual elements, they are not interactive

## Results page

- A search input is displayed in the header to be able to search again
- All retrieved results are displayed as a list
- When clicking on an item title, additional information will be displayed in a box
- If no results are found, a message should be displayed
- If no search term is used, another message should be displayed

## Data

- All data is created using [faker.js](https://github.com/faker-js/faker)
- Images are from random animals, so it’s ok if they don’t match the selected item
- Animals are searched by both title and type

## Objectives

- [ ] Build this application as a production grade code.
- [ ] Focus on replicating the given screenshots/design
- [ ] Provide at least one test validating some use cases
- [ ] What would you have done differently if you had more time? Why?
